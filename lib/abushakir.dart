/// Abushakir (Ge'ez: Bahire Hasab) is an arabic word that can be defined as a time-tracking method,

///

/// ```
///
/// ## Ethiopian Date and Time
///
/// Use [EtDatetime] to represent moment in time.
/// You can also User [Duration] dart built it package to represent time span.
///
/// You can create EtDatetime object using one of the constructors or just by
/// parsing string with the correct format and also from UNIX timestamp.
///
/// ```
/// EtDatetime now = new EtDatetime.now();
/// EtDatetime covid19Confirmed = new EtDatetime(year: 2012, month: 7, day: 4);
///
/// EtDatetime emergencyLockdown = EtDatetime.parse("2012-07-26 23:00:00");

/// Reingold's [Calendrical Calculations]
/// <https://www.amazon.com/Calendrical-Calculations-Nachum-Dershowitz/dp/0521702380>,
/// where it's the base calendar for
/// all computations.  See the book for algorithms for converting between
/// Ethiopic ordinals and many other calendar systems.
///
/// This calendar considers Monday as the beginning of the week. It does not do
/// any formatting, the base class, but any one who is working with this library
/// can use the output as the way they want to use.
///
/// You can create Ethiopian Calendar, ETC, object using one of the constructors
///
/// ```
/// ETC ethiopianCalendar = new ETC(year: 2012, month: 7, day: 4);
/// ETC today = ETC.today()

/// ( Arabic: Abu Shakir) is a time-tracking method, devised by the 12th pope
/// of Alexandria, Pope St. Dimitri. This is the Ge'ez equivalent of Abushakir.
///
/// Bahire Hasab also helps man keep track of time, reminding him of the
/// Fasting seasons, prayer hours and Holidays.
///
/// You can create BahireHasab object using constructor
///
/// ```
/// BahireHasab someRandomYear = BahireHasab(year: 2011);

/// // Year parameter is optional. If year is not provided, it will assume the
/// current year.
